# BookLibrarySystem-Python
For the Introduction to Programming module we were tasked with creating a system for a Library Assistant.
Aspect ratio may be out since I had to ensure it looked perfect for the machines they ran on.

# Details
Hover over the bars in the bar chart for a nice surpise.
If there are multiple entries for the same title, the total will be calculated for them together and the label will display all of the books that combine to make the total.
(E.g. Hover over 1984)

In the search window, for results where there is more than 1 result, a next button appears.
E.g. Choose member ID, type 0, to get all the books which are currently available
You can also choose what to search by.

# Setup
I have added a setup logfile for when the library is first being made 
Instruction for ratio provided in MainMenu file.
Tkinter library and matplotlib library needed to execute.
